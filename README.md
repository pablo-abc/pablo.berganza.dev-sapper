# [pablo.berganza.dev](https://pablo.berganza.dev)

This is another version of my personal web site. It was made using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) (still in early development).

Svelte is a JavaScript framework that, unlike frameworks like React/Vue/Angular, does not have a runtime. Svelte works as a compiler that updates the DOM directly when the state changes. Sapper is a framework for Svelte, inspired by Next.JS, that makes it easy to do a SSR APP with Svelte.

This rewrite was made mostly as an experiment and to try to make a more "maintainable" version of my web site.

To run it locally:

* Clone it
* Install all dependencies with `yarn`
* Start the dev server with `yarn dev`
* Generate a static build with `yarn export`
